## Dataset Description   
 
The **Dog vs Cat** image classification dataset consists of **8005 images** for training and **2023 images** for testing, divided into two classes:

1. **Class I** = Dog üê∂  
2. **Class II** = Cat üê±

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow & Keras** to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on labeled images and achieves efficient classification using deep learning techniques.

### Features:
- Uses **CNN** for feature extraction and classification.
- Data preprocessing including **image augmentation**.
- Model evaluation using **accuracy & loss curves**.
- Deployable for real-time image classification.
